<p><strong>BINDING ARBITRATION</strong></p>

<p>ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR ORDER, USE OF THE SITE OR OTHER APPLICATION OR THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION, except that either party may seek interim relief from any state or federal court in the party's state of residence to protect the party's intellectual property rights.

The arbitration will be administered in English by the Canadian Arbitration Association ("CAA") under its then-current arbitration rules.

You can obtain procedures, rules, and fee information from the CAA at http://canadianarbitrationassociation.ca/ or 1-800-856-5154.  Any participatory arbitration hearing that you attend shall take place in Canada.  British Columbia Provincial Law will apply during the arbitration.  The judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Unless inconsistent with applicable law, each party shall bear the expense of their respective attorneys', experts' and witness fees, regardless of which party prevails in the arbitration.
</p>

<p><strong>NO CLASS ACTIONS</strong></p>
<p>TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES ON A CONSOLIDATED OR CLASSWIDE BASIS; THAT IS, TO EITHER JOIN A CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY, OR ASSERT A CLAIM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE IN ANY LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR OTHER PROCEEDING. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST LUMAVI&eacute; SKINCARE IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
IF YOU HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED A PRODUCT AND YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE FOREGOING TERMS, YOU MUST TELL US IN WRITING AND RETURN THE PRODUCT TO GET A REFUND.</p>
<h4><strong>9.  GOVERNING LAW</strong></h4>
<p>These Terms shall be construed and enforced solely in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada, as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the Province of British Columbia (without regard to conflict of law principles).  The state or local courts in the Province of British Columbia will have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over all controversies in connection with these Terms, and you hereby consent to such exclusive and personal jurisdiction and venue.  Any claim you might have against us must be brought within two (2) years after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.  In addition, you agree to waive any right to a jury trial in connection with any action or litigation in any way arising out of or related to these Terms.
